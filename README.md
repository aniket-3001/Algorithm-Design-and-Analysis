# Algorithm-Design-and-Analysis
This Repository contains my code implementations from the course CSE-222 Algorithm Design and Analysis at my college IIITD. 

Referencing from lecture notes of previous batches for this course is not worth anything, trust me. If you are looking for resources to study the topics, I recommend you go to the "Helpful Notes" directory and choose from there. I have included each and every material that was covered in ADA'24 Section-B (very identical to section-A), and have included the proper resource of where the aforementioned topic can be studied from, i.e the best of the best resources.

Other than this, if you are able to understand the same in the class, well and good, since that is probably the most time-saving learning. I have also included solutions to my homework solutions, lab solutions, and solutions to the problem sets, which were majorly derived from Jeff Erickson, and a majority portion of both the midsem and the endsem examinations are directly asked from the latter. Good luck!
